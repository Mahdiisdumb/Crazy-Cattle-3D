# CrazyCattle3D Web Port
## You can play the game at [cattle.thoren.co](https://cattle.thoren.co)!

This repository contains modified project files of the game **CrazyCattle3D** by Anna.  
The original Godot project files were downloaded from the [official itch.io page](https://4nn4t4t.itch.io/crazycattle3d), **all credits go to Anna for these**.

The website is automatically updated by GitHub Actions when changes are pushed here. The workflows export the Godot project as an HTML game, apply necessary changes to the code, optimize the files, and can deploy to multiple hosting providers.

---

Assets like `.glb` models and `.wav` audio files have been optimized to reduce file size while maintaining quality. This allows the `.pck` file to load much faster when starting the game.

After the project is exported, the `.wasm` (WebAssembly) file generated by Godot is optimized using [wasm-opt](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen). Similarly, the `.js` and `.html` files are minified using [terser](https://github.com/terser/terser).

Large files are compressed using the [brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli) compression algorithm to greatly speed up loading under slow connections.

This port behaves exactly like the original, with the physics being untouched and user data being saved like usual.

## GitHub Actions Workflows

This repository uses three separate GitHub Actions workflows:

- **[Build Game with Godot](build.yml)** - Compiles and optimizes the game on every push
- **[Deploy to GitHub Pages](deploy-github-pages.yml)** - Publishes to GitHub Pages after build
- **[Deploy to Cloudflare Pages](deploy-cloudflare-pages.yml)** - Publishes to Cloudflare Pages with Brotli compression

### Using in your fork:

**Make sure to disable any workflows you aren't using in Actions settings**

**GitHub Pages:** Enable in Settings → Pages, set source to "GitHub Actions"

**Cloudflare Pages:** Add these secrets in Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - Your Cloudflare API token with Pages permissions
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your Cloudflare account ID
- `CF_PAGES_PROJECT_NAME` - Your Cloudflare Pages project name
