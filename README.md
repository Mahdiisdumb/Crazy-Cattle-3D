# CrazyCattle3D Web Port
This repository contains modified project files of the game **CrazyCattle3D** by Anna.  
The original Godot project files were downloaded from the [official itch.io page](https://4nn4t4t.itch.io/crazycattle3d), **all credits go to Anna for these**.
The website is automatically updated by GitHub Actions when changes are pushed here. The workflows export the Godot project as an HTML game, apply necessary changes to the code, optimize the files, and can deploy to multiple hosting providers.
Assets like `.glb` models and `.wav` audio files have been optimized to reduce file size while maintaining quality. This allows the `.pck` file to load much faster when starting the game.
After the project is exported, the `.wasm` (WebAssembly) file generated by Godot is optimized using [wasm-opt](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen). Similarly, the `.js` and `.html` files are minified using [terser](https://github.com/terser/terser).
Large files are compressed using the [brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli) compression algorithm to greatly speed up loading under slow connections.
This port behaves exactly like the original, with the physics being untouched and user data being saved like usual.
